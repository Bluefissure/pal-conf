Manage you [Palworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/) server settings in a friendly way!

## Use

Both `WorldOption.sav` and `PalWorldSettings.ini` settings are supported:

- Some entries in `PalWorldSettings.ini` don't work (such as `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum`).
- `WorldOption.sav` will take precedence over `PalWorldSettings.ini` if both files exist.

### PalWorldSettings.ini

The `PalWorldSettings.ini` file is located in:

- Windows: `steamapps/common/PalServer/Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/PalWorldSettings.ini`
- Linux: `steamapps/common/PalServer/Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini`

The load & copy buttons communicate with your clipboard, please copy your server setings before click the load button,
and the copy button will copy the output settings for you.

### WorldOption.sav

The `WorldOption.sav` file is located in:

- Windows & Linux: `steamapps/common/PalServer/Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/.../WorldOption.sav`

It's not created by default in dedicated servers, you can either create a local world and upload it, or just edit in the website and download it into the directory.

### Change PalWorldSettings.ini to WorldOption.sav

You can simply switch mode without losing any data! So you can simply:

1. Paste your `PalWorldSettings.ini` settings in `PalWorldSettings.ini` mode
2. Switch to `WorldOption.sav` mode
3. Download and place `WorldOption.sav` to the correct folder
